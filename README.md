Paul Hudson's 100 Days Of Swift challenge 

Day 1.

Variables and Constants

Program needs to store data. In Swift there are two ways to do it, variables and constants.
Variables is a data store that can have its value changed whenever you want. Constants is a data store that you set once and can never change. 
Variable using var keyword var.
Constant use the let keyword.
Variable and constant names must be unique in code.

Types of Data

There are lots of kinds of data and Swift handles them individually. 
Strings, literally a string of characters, can be long or empty.
Another important data type are called Int, short for integer. Integers are round numbers. 

Float and Double

Swift have two more data types to store data called Float and Double. This is a Swift way to store data with fractional numbers: 3, 30, 300.
Official Apple recommendation is always to use Double because it has highest accuracy.
